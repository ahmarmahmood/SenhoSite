  <div class="text-container">
    <h4 class="text-heading" style="padding-right: 2.6em;">Since our inception, <span class="senho-red">Senho</span> has been totally focused on building a strategic, quality IT Consulting firm.</h4>
    <div class="senho-text">
      <p>In our first project we upgraded a 50-year-old company in the hospitality business, which was using paper and simple spreadsheets. We automated their workflow and built robust, web-based solutions that scale as their business grows. We built systems that give meaningful insight over their growth and the future of their business, and be more visible to the public.</p>
      <p>We have not stopped here. We are working to further increase their growth and optimize their whole business process.</p>
      <p>We started this from a very small task and now our offshore team represents 95% of their IT department due to the exponential growth and reduced cost to IT that they have experienced because of our services.</p>
